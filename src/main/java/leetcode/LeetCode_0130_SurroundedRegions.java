//Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.
//
//		A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.
//
//		Example:
//
//		X X X X
//		X O O X
//		X X O X
//		X O X X
//		After running your function, the board should be:
//
//		X X X X
//		X X X X
//		X X X X
//		X O X X
//		Explanation:
//
//		Surrounded regions shouldn’t be on the border, which means that any 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'.
//		Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'.
//		Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.
