/*Given a non-empty array of unique positive integers A, consider the following graph:

        There are A.length nodes, labelled A[0] to A[A.length - 1];
        There is an edge between A[i] and A[j] if and only if A[i] and A[j] share a common factor greater than 1.
        Return the size of the largest connected component in the graph.*/
