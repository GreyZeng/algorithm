/*Given two strings s and t, return the number of distinct subsequences of s which equals t.

        A string's subsequence is a new string formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).

        It's guaranteed the answer fits on a 32-bit signed integer.



        Example 1:

        Input: s = "rabbbit", t = "rabbit"
        Output: 3
        Explanation:
        As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from S.
        rabbbit
        rabbbit
        rabbbit
        Example 2:

        Input: s = "babgbag", t = "bag"
        Output: 5
        Explanation:
        As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from S.
        babgbag
        babgbag
        babgbag
        babgbag
        babgbag


        Constraints:

        0 <= s.length, t.length <= 1000
        s and t consist of English letters.*/
